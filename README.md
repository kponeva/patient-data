# Healthcare App for Patients Record in Hospital

This project aims to measure how far I understand the application of Python programming by directly applying it to a transactional mini application. Working on this project enriched me with basic functions of Python programming, how it works and how to use it when applied to an integrated application. In this project, I will use a case study on managing patients record on App that commonly used in healthcare system such as hospital.  

## Main Features

The application has 4 main features, I need to be able to create applications that meet or exceed the standard requirements that have been determined as follows:

*1. Create Feature*. 
I created a def function that can add data to the patients record based on user input that follows to the existing flow.

*2. Read Feature*  
I created a def function that can display all data from the existing record or display certain data according to the user's choice in which the function runs according to the existing flow.

*3. Update Feature*  
I created a def function that can update or change the value from the options on patients record selected by the user according to the existing flow.

*4. Delete Feature*  
I created a def function that can delete data from the patients record based on user input.

*5. System Integration and Code Efficiency*  
I created programs that are interconnected and continuous between features and pay attention to speed, space and maintainability of the coding I made.
